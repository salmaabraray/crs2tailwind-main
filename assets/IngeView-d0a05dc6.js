Who am I, what do I like to eat and how can I combine these things in a photo? I have never worked with a professional camera, so this was a new experience for me. I bought white model paper that I used to photograph on. I decided to take my photos looking down, as I tend to look down at food. My eating habits are extremely varied, I wanted to visualize them. I looked for some inspiration in the library. ")],-1),c={class:"pt-4 pb-4"},p=e("div",{class:"font1"}," During the block I took some new photos, because I was not yet completely convinced of my final 30 photos. After taking some new photos, I started thinking about how I want to organize my photos. Which comes first, which comes last. Since I have photographed a lot of food related to pain and discomfort, I decided to classify my photos by feeling. The first photo doesn't give me a good feeling. As the end progresses there is a hierarchical structure with ultimately what gives me the best feeling. I chose a simple layout with my image on one side and 1 sentence on the other side with the three latch principles indicated in a different font. In my opinion, this gave the photos their 'moment'. The text only had to ensure that the photo came into its own. I just thought it was a bit 'simple' to indicate or underline the latch principles in bold, so I opted for two different fonts. For my cover I used the same fonts as on the inside of my booklet. I called my book 'Sabr, it only gets better'. Sabr means 'patience' in Riffian. Because my roots have a major influence on my diet, I thought it would be nice to translate the word patience on the front page. I went to print my final product in the Mechelen print shop. On second thought, I probably shouldn't have done this. In my opinion, the photos are dark and not as light as on the computer and separate prints, as well as a bit blurry... In addition, there was not much choice for the binding of the booklet, so I opted for a booklet with rings. I couldn't print a booklet with a spine because I didn't have enough pages. All in all, I am satisfied with my final product. I learned a lot in terms of research, working with illustrator, printers and most importantly, telling a story. For the final jury in June, I would like to print my book again, but with a sewn binding and a different type of paper. Because apart from the printing, I think I have done a nice job.
